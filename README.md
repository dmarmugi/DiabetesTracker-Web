Track Insulin injections (time + location) for Cats

## Overview
My cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes and put on insulin. The protocol is an insulin injection twice a day, on alternating sides, and different locations. This project is intended to keep track of her shots, send reminders, and suggest locations to avoid repetition.
